            "message": "<pre>Instead of listing installed modules, help('modules') prints a \"please\nwait\" message, then a traceback noting that a module raised an exception\nduring import, then nothing else.\nThis happens in 2.5 and 2.6a0, but not in 2.4, which apparently doesn't\n__import__() EVERY module.\nTested only on Gentoo Linux 2.6.19, but same behavior is probable on\nother platforms because pydoc and pkgutil are written in cross-platform\nPython.\n\nProminent 3rd party libraries that break help('modules') include Django,\nPyglet, wxPython, SymPy, and Pypy. Arguably, the bug is in those\nlibraries, but they have good reasons for their behavior. Also, the Unix\nphilosophy of forgiving input is a good one. Also, __import__()ing every\nmodule takes a significant run-time hit, especially if libraries compute\neg. configuration.\n\nThe patch utilizes a pre-existing hook in pkgutil to simply quietly add\nthe module to the output. (Long live lambda.)</pre>\n   \n",
